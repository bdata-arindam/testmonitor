1. **Install Required Dependencies**: Ensure that you have installed the required Python packages by running:

   ```
   pip install confluent-kafka tabulate
   ```

2. **Replace Placeholder Values**: Replace the placeholder values in `config.json` and `kafka_select.json` with your actual Kafka cluster information, query logic, and any other specific configurations.

3. **Optional Output Module**: If you are using an output module (as specified in `config.json`), make sure to create the `output_module.py` file with your custom output handling logic.

4. **Ensure SSL and Kerberos Configuration**: If your Kafka cluster uses SSL and Kerberos, make sure to configure the `config.json` with the appropriate security settings and certificate paths.

5. **File Paths**: Ensure that the file paths for certificate locations, module locations, and log locations are valid.

6. **Message Content Logic**: Implement the logic in `get_query_identifier` to extract the query identifier based on the message content.

7. **Custom Query Logic**: Modify the code in `run_select_query` and `process_message` to match your specific query processing and message handling requirements.

Once you have made these adjustments, you can execute the code by running:

```
python consumer_script.py
```

Make sure you have a Kafka topic with relevant messages that match the conditions specified in `kafka_select.json` for testing. The script should start consuming messages, applying select queries, and processing them based on your logic.

Please test the code in your development or testing environment before deploying it in a production environment to ensure it meets your requirements.
